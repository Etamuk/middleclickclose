middleclickclose
================

Gnome shell extension for closing apps in overview with a middle click

All credit goes to Paolo Tranquilli (http://cs.unibo.it/~tranquil/en/hacking.html), I've merely copied its code here and I plan to provide Gnome Shell 3.10 compatibility

Up to gnome shell 3.8 this is installable from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/352/middle-click-to-close-in-overview/. Otherwise you may download a zip from there and copy folder middleclickclose@paolo.tranquilli.gmail.com in .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions, then reload gnome-shell (Alt-F2, r, Enter) and activate it through Gnome Tweak Tool.
